mom:
     }
I just wanted to clarify why i don't feel the need or want to communicate with
you or any of the rest of our family anymore. I do not appreciate the ways you
treated Geshini and it is not acceptable the behaviours that you did to her.
She did nothing wrong to you nor was there any reason for you to treat her the
way you did. It was immature, and completely unacceptable which is one of the
sole reasons why i do not want to contact you or any of the family anymore.
I've tried to fix the situation but everyone has been too obvlivious to at
least be civil, therefore the only option that i see possible is to entirely
cut contact with you as well as the rest of the family.

tina:
I just wanted to clarify why i don't feel the need to communicate with you or
anyone else in the family anymore. It was completely unnaceptable the way you
talked about Gesh, and regardless of whatever reasons or excuses you have to
justify it it was completely immature, and it was NOT out of love for me as i
communicated to both you and mom that i did not appreciate how you were
treating her. Gesh did nothing to you nor anyone in the family to be treated in
the manner in which you did and for this reason i do not see it possible to
communicate with you or the rest of the family anymore. I've tried to fix it
but from what i've seen no one is actually changing and being genienly decent,
it's all just a charade. 

mia:
I just wanted to clarify why i don't feel the need to communicate with you or
the rest of the family anymore. You were actually okay somewhat, for the most
part mia, but you also changed spiratically. Some days you would be yourself
and alright to Gesh and at other times you would ignore her or would say
something that wasn't okay. Its okay to have your own opinion on things but its
important how you express that opinion, if you say something rudely, or not
thought out clearly it can come across as mean so be weary of that.



session 5)
Keep an ongoing tally as to when the clinical journaling works and doesn't work.

--> worked every time this week

Ask questions, how does the urge feel like?

Ask any questions that comes to mind, to understand what the urge represents?

session 6)
make a way so that you can clinically journal more then once, have a seperate
page if you need to journal more then once or something.

Try to understand it and write this information down.

Not feeling good at the end of masturbating with fur, why?

learn about the triggers, whats going on physically, emotionally, mentally

and also duration how long it lasts

ask the questions and record responses in journal 

session 7) before you get involved in the behaviour, write down whats going
down internally, whats the situation? why did the urge arise

next time i feel anxiety, try to identify what i feel anxious about.

    do inner dialogue about how gesh doesnt want me to fix the problem, but to
    just be there and be supportive (inner child->inner parent)

    inner parent hopefully can provide a way to understand that to inner child

    Ask how she felt ever since big thing

    inner dialogue with inner child about lack of empathy, why cant you feel
    her pain? ask her how she feels and try to feel her pain (this allows you
    to feel empathy)

    session 8) write down inner dialogues that go on throughout the day

    session 9.) read a maximum of twenty minutes a day - if all other
    responsibilities are done then you can extend this time

    session 10.) say something nurturing to inner child in a nurturing way to
    let inner child know how far we can go and to not give in

    what is the reason for uncertainty? is it that "im not good enough" or "i
    dont deserve it"

    session 11.)

    inner dialogues about: uncertainty deeper or clearer sense of the triggers
    for masturbation and what it really does, what are sensations that i feel
    before OR during what would i have to give up to stop masturbating with
    fur, and what can i replace it with (try to find what its doing for me)

    ask inner child why he laughs when momments are serious.

    Session 12:) be with the fear and stay with it as long as you can until you
    cannot any longer then you can change focus.

    if i masturbate try to have self talk during the entire momment


ASK THERAPIST IF CAN STOP SELF PARENTING AND INSTEAD ONLY DO INNER DIALOGUE
DURING INNER CONFLICT ( WHEN ABOUT TO WASH ) 

    session 13;) before masturbating catch the thoughts PRIOR to the thoughts
    about masturbating write down what im doing when i bite my nails
    acknowledge feeling low, and be compassionate say something like " im not
    going to give up im not going to stop trying" try a more nurturing approach
    rather then a super hard disciplined one Tell my parents and family how i
    feel about how they treated gesh before she comes back in august


    Session 14:) Gesh wants me to tell my therapist that me and her aren't
    actually together but i've been saying we are. (DONE) Insert feelings need
    to say something but its hard to talk about how do i go about speaking
    about it with her or you. she thinks that i'm numb because i'm hiding
    something and she said i laugh in momments when i shouldn't I'm very
    complacent when i do something wrong, and i do that routinely. And she
    doesn't understand why i keep trying to get back with her because i'm not
    putting any effort She's severely damaged and depressed from me. (DONE)
    tell therapist i lost feelings for her tell therapist that because i'm
    hiding something from her which if i told her i feel it would ensure there
    is no change in us being together i gave up on myself and therefore i've
    really given up on her and have abandoned myself from her She is depressed
    because of me, her smile went away she doesn't smile much anymore Ask
    therapist what he thinks i should do (at the end AFTER HE RESPONDS) I went
    back mostly to my emotional self after she went to saint kitts

    Session 15:) We discussed that my girlfriend and I broke up several months
    ago We also discussed that i should think about/write down ways in which i
    would connect with my grandparents 


    TODO WRITE MESSAGE TO PARENTS AND FAM dad: I just wanted to clarify why i
    don't feel the need or want to communicate with you or anyone else in our
    family anymore. SESSION 16.)

    See my girlfriend as my ex and really feel how it feels journal about the
    experience about feeling my feelings and being aware of my feelings
    maintain awareness that my girlfriend isnt my girlfriend ask myself how im
    feeling a lot gallows laugh -> i laugh when times are sad rubber band
    reminder for awareness, when you see it you snap it think about my sister
    or mom to FEEL anger, to be connected with my emotions

    Session 16.) when thinking about the urge just accept that you can do it
    and try to understand it and  understand the reasons why you do it. give
    yourself full permission to enter into it and use all that energy to
    understand it focus on NOT RESISTING URGES and trying to understand and
    learn more about them.

    session 17.) 1.) surrender to the urge right away with the need to
    understand it, because there will be some type of insight that comes from
    understanding it

    2.) look at surrender as success, think about jujitsu how you go with the
    move to get out

    3.) Journal about "im not gonna resist the urge"

    4.) do something good for gesh every time you have an urge

    session 18.) go back to that day that my mom told me stuff and write down
    the things that my mom said to me. identify "shoulds" i SHOULD do this and
    should do that.
    
    ========================================================================
    HOMEWORK COMPLETION
    
    I remember my mom saying something like "snap out of it" because i kept
    trying to go onto my phone to comfort my ex. I remember being very sad and
    crying a bit whilst sitting at the dinner table not speaking with my ex. My
    mom kept telling me to snap out of it and to go workout and not to message
    my ex.

    I remember her saying stuff like "this shouldn't be going on this long, or
    you apologized so theres nothing else you can do. 

    SHOULDS: i should NOT be emotional with my ex (this wasn't explicitly said
    but it was certainly conveyed by the interaction with my mom)

    My mom also overheard me talking with my ex about what happened and
    comforting her. This went on for a day or two and my mom labeled this as
    "circle talk" because we were going over what happened for a while. She
    then told me not to go back into this "circle talk", which basically meant
    not to comfort my girlfriend after i hurt her

    My mom also said i should workout, and go on a walk and i guess sort of
    ignore my ex.

    That night was really emotionally taxing for my ex, we talked about it
    months after and she said she couldn't fall asleep and had to call a friend
    and asked her friend to say jokes to try and make her laugh so she wasn't
    crying and could fall asleep.
    
    ========================================================================
    
    session 19.) THIS HELPED GESH FEEL WELL! " I will help dont worry you got
    this " tell gesh that im working on trying to help her and the only way i
    can do that is by practicing, im usually silent cause i don't know what to
    say

   * Let my ex know when i don't feel very present
    
   * Do inner dialogues with inner child about the day that happened and the

   * Understand my emotions during interactions with people and how they make

    === SELF COMPASSION BOOK ===
    session 21: 
    
    
    
    tell therapist: do you think i should go to psychotherapy for my emotional
    numbness, and do you believe that will help me?
    
    TODO
    My dad and my sister came over to the house here and my ex was suggesting that
    i go down to eat whilst they were here and to use that as an opportunity to 
    stand up for her and for allt he wrong that they did to me. For some reason i
    feel a lot of fear to stand up to my parents and the only thing that comes into
    my mind is excuses
