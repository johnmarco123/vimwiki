AND -> $x.y$ = $x \land y$
OR -> $x + y$ = $x \lor y$
NOT -> $x'$ = $ \lnot x$

When no parentheses are used this is the logical order:
NOT > AND > OR


Postulates of boolean algebra

Huntington's postulates: 
    1. Closure, the value of any Boolean operation is either zero or one.
    2. Identity, the value of x plus 0 and x.1 is always equal to the value of x.
    3. Distributivity $x + y = y + x$
    4. Commutativity. Plus and dot are both commutative. That is, x plus y equals y plus x and x.y equals y.x. 
    5. Complements. The logical sum of x and it's corresponding complement is
       always equal to one where the logical products of x and its corresponding
       complement is always equal to zero.
    6. Distance elements, any Boolean algebra has to have two distinct values

Basic Theorems
    Idempotent laws
       $x + x = x,\ x . x = x$ 
    
    Tautology and contradiction
    $x + 1 = 1,\ x.0 = 0$
    
    Involution
    $(x')' = x$
    
    Associative laws
    $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z),\ (x . y) . z = x . (y . z) $
    
    Absorbtion laws
    $x + (x . y) = x,\ x . (x + y) = x$
    
    Uniqueness of complement
    if $y + x = 1\ and\ y.x = 0,\ then\ x = y'$
    
    Inversion law
    $0' = 1,\ 1' = 0$
    
Principles:
    
    principle of duality:
    A + BC = (A + B)(B + C) === A(B + C) = AB + BC
    
    
Given the boolean function $F(x, y, z) = (x + \lnot y).\ z$
write the sum of products expansion of F where all variables
x, y, and z are used
$F(x, y, z) = (x + \lnot y).\ z$
$ \lnot y z + xz$                              <- Distrubitivity
$(x + \lnot x)\lnot yz + x(y+\lnot y)z$        <- identity
$x\lnot yz + \lnot x\lnot yz + xyz + x\lnot yz$<- Distrubitivity
$x\lnot yz + \lnot x\lnot yz + xyz$            <- idempotent law
