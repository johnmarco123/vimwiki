===WEEK 5===
propositions:
    basically bools, propositions can be true or false
        3 = 3
        3 < 3
        3 < 10
        my dog is a cat
    these are all propositions. They MUST have a true or false, so
    $x + 1 = 2$ is NOT a proposition
    propositional variables are used to stop repetitiveness
    $q : 1 + 1 = 2 $

Truth tables and truth sets
    two propositional values p and q truth table
        |     p    |    q     |
        |   false  |   false  |
        |   false  |   true   |
        |   true   |   false  |
        |   true   |   true   |
    let p and q be two propositions concerning an integer n in S, defined as
    follows:
        p: n is even
        q: n is odd

        The truth set of p written as P is :
            $P = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$
        
        The truth set of q is:
            $Q = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$
    !!!IMPORTANT!!!
        the number of rows in a truth table for n propopsitions is$2^n$ 
    
    negation:$\neg p$
    conjunction: $p \land q$     
    disjunction: $p \lor q$
    xor/exclusive-or: $p \oplus q$ (NOT both true, NOT both false)

    PRESEDENCE IN LOGICAL OPERATORS
    | operator | presedence |
    |  $\lnot$ |      1     |
    |  $\land$ |      2     |
    |  $\lor$  |      3     |
    
    for example:
        $p\lor(q\land\lnot r)$ 
        can be written as:
        $p \lor q\land \lnot r$


===WEEK 6===
    Conditional statement, or implication p -> q
        p -> q
        is the same as:
        if p then q
    p is called the hypothesis
    q is called conclusion

    | p | q | p -> q |
    | F | F |    T   |
    | F | T |    T   |
    | T | F |    F   |
    | T | T |    T   |

    different expressions of p -> q
        p -> q
        if p then q
        if p, q
        p implies q
        p only if q
        q follows from p
        p is sufficient for q
        q unless$\lnot p$
        q is necessary for p

    converse, contrapositive and inverse
    let p and q be propositions and A the conditional statement p -> q
        the proposition q -> p is the converse of A
        the proposition$\lnot q$->$\lnot p$is the contrapositive of A
        the proposition$\lnot p$->$\lnot q$is the inverse of A

    equivelence can be represented by:
        <->
        ===
    if the truth tables are the same then the statements are equivelant
        p === q
        or 
        p <-> q

    | p | q | (p -> q) and (q -> p) |
    | T | T | ((true -> true = true) and (true -> true = true)) = true
    | T | F | ((true -> false = false) and (false -> true = true)) = false 
    | F | T | ((false -> true = true) and (true -> false = false)) = false 
    | F | F | ((false -> false = true) and (false -> false = true)) = true
