== Valid argument ==
    * An argument in propositional logic is a sequence of propositions
    * The final proposition is called the conclusion and the other propositions
      in the argument are called the premises (or hypotheses)
    * An argument is valid if the truth of all its premises implies the truth
      of the conclusion.

= Building a valid argument =
    * To build a valid argument we need to follow the steps below:
        * If initially written in English, transform the statement into an
          argument form by achoosing a variable for each simple proposition
        * Start with the hypothesis of the argument
        * Build a sequence of steps in swhich each step follows from the
          previous step by applying:
            * rules of inference
            * laws of logic
        * The final step of the argument is the conclusion.
EXAMPLE 1.)
Let's build a valid argument from the following premises:
$\lnot p:"It\ is\ not\ cold\ tonight."$
$q\rightarrow p:"We\ will\ go\ to\ the\ theatre\ only\ if\ it\ is\ cold"$
$\lnot q\rightarrow r:"If\ we\ do\ not\ go\ to\ the\ theatre\, we\ will\ watch\ a movie\ at\ home."$
$r\rightarrow s:"If\ we\ watch\ a movie\ at\ home\, we\ will\ need\ to\ make\ popcorn."$

Propositional variables:
$p:"It\ is\ cold\ tonight." $
$q:"We\ wil\ go\ to\ the\ theatre."$
$r:"We\ will\ watch\ a\ movie\ at\ home."$
$s:"We\ will\ need\ to\ make\ popcorn"$

1.)$p\rightarrow q$       <--Hypothesis
2.)$\lnot p$              <--Hypothesis
3.)$\therefore \lnot q$   <-- Modus tollens 1, 2
4.)$\lnot q\rightarrow r$ <--Hypothesis
5.)$\therefore r$         <--Modus tollens 3, 4
6.)$r\rightarrow s$       <--Hypothesis
7.)$\therefore s$         <--Modus tollens 5, 6

<span style="color:#cc241d;">Conclusion: "We will need to make popcorn."</span>

= Fallacies =
    * A fallacy is the use of a incorrect argument when reasoning
    * Formal fallacies can be expressed in propositional logic and proved to be
      incorrect
    * Some of the widely used formal fallacies are:
        * affirming the consequent
        * a conclusion that denies premises
        * contradictory premises
        * denying the antecedent
        * existential fallacy
        * exclusive premesis.
EXAMPLE
    * Let's consider the following argument:
        * If you have internet access, you can order this book
        * You can order this book
       ---------------------------------------------------------- 
    * This argument can be formalised as: if p -> q and q, then p
    * Where p: "You have Internet access."
    *       q: "you can order this book."
    * The proposition $((p\rightarrow q)\land q)\rightarrow p$ 
      is not a tautology, because it is false when p is false and q is true
