Question 1. Prove that the sum of any two even integers is even. In an other
way show that: $\forall n,\ m\in\Z,$ if n and m are even numbers then n + m
is also an even number.

    Let $n,\ m\in\Z,$and assume that n and m are even, we need to show that n + m
    is also even. We know that an even number is two times an integer i. This
    can be represented as n = 2i, and m = 2j. Therefore n + m = 2i + 2j = 2(i + j).
    Hence, there exists an integer k = i + j such n + m = 2k. It followed by
    definition of even numbers that n + m is also even.
    



Question 2.) Use direct proof to show that: $\forall n,\ m\in\Z$ if n is an even
number and m is an odd number then 3n + 2m is also an even number.
    
    Let $n,\ m\in\Z$ and assume n is even and m is odd. We know that an even integer
    can be represented as n = 2i, and an odd integer can be represented as m = 2j + 1
    Therefore, 3n + 2m = 3(2i) + 2(2j + 1)  
                       = 6i + 4j + 2  
                       = 2(3i + 2j + 1)
    
    Hence, there exists an integer k = 2(3i + 2j + 1) such 3n + 2m = 2k. It follows,
    by definition of even numbers, that 3n + 2m is an even number
    
    
    
Question 3.) Prove that the sum of any two odd integers is EVEN. In an other way
show that: $\forall n,\ m\in\Z,$ 
if n and m are odd numbers then n + m is an even number.

    Let $n,\ m\in\Z$ and assume n and m are both odd numbers. We know we can represent
    odd integers like so: n = 2i + 1, m = 2j + 1. 
    Therefore n + m = 2i + 1 + 2j + 1.
                    = 2i + 2j + 2.
                    = 2(i + j + 1).
    
   Hence, there exists an integer k = i + j + 1 such n + m = 2k. It follows, by
   definition of even numbers, that n + m is an even number as well.
    
    
Question 4.) Show that for any odd number integer n, $n^2$ is also odd. In
another way show that: $\forall\ n\in\Z,\ \text{if n is odd then }n^2\ is\ also\ odd.$
    
   let $n\in\Z$ and assume n is an odd number. We can represent odd numbers like so:
   n = 2i + 1. We need to show that there is an integer k such that $n^2 = 2k + 1$
   Therefore $n^2 = (2i + 1)^2$
                         $n^2 = (2i + 1)(2i + 1)$
                         $n^2 = 4i^2 + 2i + 2i + 1$
                         $n^2 = 4i^2 + 4i+ 1$
                         $n^2 = 2(2i^2 + 2i) + 1$
    
    Hence, There exists an integer $k = 2i^2 + 2i\ such\ that\ n^2 = 2k+ 1 $
    It follows, by definition of odd numbers, that $n^2$ is odd.
    
    
    
    
Question 5.) Show that $\forall x\in\R\forall m\in\Z,\ \lfloor x + m \rfloor = \lfloor x\rfloor + m.$
    
   Let x be any real number, and m be any integer. We must show that 
   $\lfloor x + m\rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + m$ 
   
    Let n be an integer with $\lfloor x\rfloor = n\ \text{By definition of the floor function,}$
    it follows that:
            
        $n\le x < n + 1$
        
    by adding the value m to all parts of the inequality we obtain:
            
            $(n + m)\le (x + m) < (n + m) + 1$
            
    Hence, $\lfloor x + m \rfloor = n + m$
    Finally, by substituting n by $\lfloor x\rfloor,\ we\ get\ \lfloor x + m\rfloor = \lfloor x\rfloor + m.$
    This ends the proof.
    
    
    
Question 6.) Use proof by contraposition show that for any integer n, if $n^2$
is even then n is even

   $\text{If our equation is }p\rightarrow q\ \text{the contrapositive would be }\lnot q\rightarrow \lnot p$ 
   Therefore, we will show that for any integer n, if $n^2$ is not even (is odd)
   then $n$ is not even (is odd)
   
   We will assume that $n^2$ is an odd number. By the definition of odd numbers
   this would mean that $n^2 = (2i + 1)^2$Knowing this we will prove that n is 
   also a odd number, which is represented by $n = 2i + 1$.
   
   It follows that:
                  $n^2 = (2i+1)^2$ 
                  $n^2 = 4i^2 + 4i + 1$ 
                  $n^2 = 2(2i^2 + 2i) + 1$ 
                  $n^2 = 2i^2 + 2i$ 
  is an integer as it is the sum of products of integers, Therefore there
  exists k = $2i^2 + 2i$ such that $n^2 = 2k + 1$. Hence $n^2$ is an odd
  number. Therefore, for all interger n, if $n^2$is also even. n is even.
   
    
    
    
    
Question 7.) Use proof by contraposition show that for any integer n if 
$5\nmid n^2\ then\ 5\nmid n$

    The contraposition would be for any integer n if $5\mid n\ then\ 5\mid n^2$
    Suppose n is an integer such that $5\mid n$. We must show that $5\mid n^2$ 
    By definition of divisibility $n = 5k$. By substitution: $n = 5k = 5(5k^2)$ 
    hence, there exists an integer i = $5k^2$ such that $n^2 = 5i$. Hence,
    $5\mid n^2$. Therefore any integer n, if $5\nmid n^2\ then\ 5\nmid n$





Question 8.) Use proof by contradiction to show that for any integer n, if $n^2$
is even then n is even
    
   Assume there exists an integer n such that $n^2$ is even and n is odd. n
   is odd hence n can be written as $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer k. By substitution
   it follows that $n^2 = (2k+1)^2$
                   $n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$
                   $n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$
    $2k^2 + 2k$  is an integer because the products and sums of integers are integers.
    So there is an integer $i=2k^2 + 2\ with\ n^2 = 2i + 1,$ and thus by definition $n^2$
    is odd. This is a contradiction of the hypothesis as $n^2$is even. This ends the proof.
    
    
    
    
Question 9.) Use proof by contradiction to show that for any integer n, 3n + 2
is not divisible by 3.

    Assume there exists an integer n such that $3n + 2$ is divisible by 3.
    Hence, there exists an integer k such that $k = 3m+2 = 3k $ and thus
    $m = k - \frac{2}{3}$ Therefore m is not an integer and this contradicts our
    initial hypothesis which says that m is an integers. Hence, $\forall n\in\Z,$
    3n + 2 is not divisible by 3. This ends the proof.




Question 10.) Use proof by contradiction to show that for any integer n, 7n + 4
is not divisible by 7.

    Assume there exists an integer n such that $7n + 4$ is divisible by 7.
    Hence, there exists an integer k such that $7m + 4 = 7k$ and thus:
    
    $7k = 7m + 4$
    
    $7k - 4 = 7m$
    
    $\frac{7k - 4}{7} = 7m$
    
    $k - \frac{4}{7} = m$
    
    $m= k - \frac{4}{7} $
    Therefore, m is not an integer and this contradicts our initial hypothesis
    which says that m is an integers. Hence, $\forall\ n\in\Z,\ 7n+4$ 
    is not divisible by 7. This ends the proof
    
    


Question 11.) Write the following series in $\sum$notation 


    1. 1 + 3 + 5 ... (2n - 1)

    1 + 3 + 5 ... (2n - 1) = $\sum_{k = 1}^n (2n - 1)$



    2. 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ... + 1024
    
    1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ... + 1024 = $\sum_{k = 0}^10  (2 ^ k)$

    Evaluate the following:
        
        1. $\sum_{k=1}^10 (4k - 2)$
         
         
         $\sum_{k=1}^10 (4k - 2)$
         
         $\sum_{k=1}^10 4k - \sum_{k=1}^10 2$
         
         $4\sum_{k=1}^10 k - 2\sum_{k=1}^10 1$
         
         $4\  \frac{10*11}{2} - 2 * 10 = 200$
         
         
         
         
        2.  $\sum_{k = 41}^100 k$
         
            $\sum_{k = 41}^100 k = $
         
            $\sum_{k = 1}^100 k -\sum_{k = 1}^40 k = \frac{100*101}{2} - \frac{40 * 41}{2} = 5050 - 820 = 4230 $
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
        3. 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + ... + 300
        
        $3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + ... + 300 =$
       
       $ \sum_{k = 1}^100 3k =$
       
       $ 3\sum_{k = 1}^100 k =$
       
       $ 3\ \frac{100 * 101}{2} = \frac{35050}{2}= 15150$
