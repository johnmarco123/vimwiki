graphs have vertices and edges, an example of a graph is as follows:
    
         e1
         |
         V  
v1-->  O----O    <-- v2
       |   / \ 
       |  /   O-\
       | /       \
       |/         \
       O-----------O
    
    The O's represent the verticies and the lines represent the edges.
    The top left O can be represented as v1, and the one to the right v2
    the path between them can be v1, v2. Lets say the line between v1 and v2
    is called e1, we can say that e1 is the path
    
= trail =
    A walk in which no edge is repeated. In a trail verticies can be repeated
    but no edge is ever repeated.
    
= path =
    Definition:
        A path is a trail in which no verticies, nor edges are repeated
        
    The length of a path is the amount of edges traversed. Note, that you can 
    traverse the same edge multiple times, and that will still be added to the count,
    however, if you traverse the same edge/verticy twice it is no longer a path.
    
= circuit =
    A path that begins and ends on the same vertex. VERTICES $CAN$ BE REPEATED.
    
= cycle/closed path/ =
    Closed paths occur when you don't repeat any edges (just like a path) however
    the last walk returns to where you started, therefore it is a cycle/closed path.
    VERTICIES $CAN'T$ BE REPEATED.
    
    
= euler path =
    Definition: 
        A Eulerian path in a graph is a path that uses each EDGE precisely once. If
        such a path exists, the path is called "TRAVERSABLE"
    
= hamiltonian path =
    Definition: 
        A Hamiltonian path (also called a traceable path) is a path that visits each VERTEX
        exactly once. A graph that contains a hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph.
        
= hamiltonian cycle =
    Visits each vertex exactly once once (except the end where it visits the
    starting node for the second time).
    
= conectivity =
    An undirected graph is said to be connected if you can get from any node to
    any other node by following a sequence of edges OR any two nodes are
    connected by a path

= strong conectivity =
    A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a DIRECTED path from any
    node to any other node
    
    
    NOT STRONGLY CONNECTED
                        
    O -----> O -----> O
    ^        | 
    |        |
    |        V
    O -----> O
    
    
    STRONGLY CONNECTED
               -----       
              /     \
             |       \ 
             v        |  
    O -----> O -----> O
    ^        | 
    |        |
    |        V
    O -----> O
    
    
    
    
    
= transitive closure =
    Given a digraph G, the transitive closure of G is the digraph G* such that:
    G* has the same verticies as G if G has a directed path from u to v 
    ($u\neq v$), G* has a directed path u to vd
    
    
= undirected graphs =
    * degree of a vertex is twice its edges
    * all graphs must have a even sum of vertexes
    * isolated vertex has degree 0
    * loops count twice
    * in-deg (v) number off edges for which v is the terminal vertex,
    * out-deg (v) number of edges for which v is the initial vertex, 
    * deg(v) = out-deg(v) + in-deg(v)
