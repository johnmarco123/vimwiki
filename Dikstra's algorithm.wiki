First we initialize our table:
UNVISITED LIST {A, B, C, D, E}
____________________________________________________________      
| Vertex   | Shortest distance from a   | Previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | inf                        | undefined          |
| C        | inf                        | undefined          |
| D        | inf                        | undefined          |
| E        | inf                        | undefined          |
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 3                          | a                  |
| C        | 2                          | a                  |
| D        | inf                        | undefined          |
| E        | inf                        | undefined          |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
then we pick the vertex with the smallest known distance from start
vertex a (WHICH IS C) UNVISITED LIST {B, C, D, E}  
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 3                          | A                  |
| C        | 2                          | A                  |
| D        | 3                          | C                  |
| E        | 7                          | C                  |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
then we pick the vertex with the smallest known distance from start
vertex a (WHICH IS B) UNVISITED LIST {B, D, E}  
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 3                          | A                  |
| C        | 2                          | A                  |
| D        | 3                          | C                  |
| E        | 7                          | C                  |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
then we pick the vertex with the smallest known distance from start
vertex a (WHICH IS D) UNVISITED LIST {D, E}  
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 3                          | A                  |
| C        | 2                          | A                  |
| D        | 3                          | C                  |
| E        | 6                          | D                  |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
Now all we have is E, and E already has been attended from all 
the other calculations So this is our final table

| B        | 3                          | A                  |
| C        | 2                          | A                  |
