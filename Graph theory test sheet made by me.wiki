$\text{What is a walk?}$

A walk is a series of edges and verticies in a graph. Repeats for edges and
verticies are allowed

$\text{What is a path?}$
A path is like a walk, except you can not repeat verticies or edges

$\text{What is a cycle?}$
A cycle is a path that starts at one vertex and ends at that same vertex.

$\text{What is a eularian path?}$
A eularian path is a path in which you can not repeat edges

$\text{What is a hamiltonian path?}$

A hamiltonian path is a path in which you can not repeat verticies

$\text{What is a degree sequence?}$
A degree sequence is a list of all the vertex's degrees.

$\text{Given degree sequence n, how many edges are there?}$
    n / 2

$\text{Why does a graph need a even number for its degree sequence?}$
    Well lets say we have a graph like so:
    
    O_____O
    
    This graph has one edge, and a degree sequence of two. Adding any edge
    increases the degree sequence by two, every multiple of 2 can be divided by
    two, therefore a graph must have an even number for its degree sequence or
    it is impossible to create

$\text{What is a simple graph?}$

  A simple graph is a graph without loops and parelel edges

$\text{Given a simple graph G with n verticies, then the degree of each vertex of G is}$
$\text{at most equal to _____?}$

  n - 1

$\text{What is a n-regular graph?}$
    A n-regular graph is a graph in which every vertex has the same amount of
    degree

$\text{Can you construct a 3-regular graph with 4 verticies, explain your reasoning?}$
    3x4 = 12 which is even, thus it is constructable.

$\text{Can you construct a 3-regular graph with 5 verticies explain your reasoning?}$
    3x5 = 15 which is odd, thus it is impossible to create this graph.

$\text{Num of edges ____,  sum of degree sequence ____ and every vertex has a degree __ for}$
$\text{complete graph that has n verticies}$

    Every vertex has a degree of $(n - 1)$
    Sum of degree sequence $n(n - 1)$
    num of edges = $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

    
$\text{What is a complete graph?}$
    
    A complete graph is a graph where all of the vertex's are connected to each other.
    In other words, every vertex has n - 1 connections with n being the number of 
    vertexes in the graph.

$\text{What is the difference between an adjecency list and an adjecency matrix?}$
    An adjacency list looks like this:
    $A = \{B, C\}$
    $B = \{A\}$
    $C = \{A\}$
    
    whilst an adjacency matrix looks like this:
      $A\ B\ C$
    $A\ 1\ 1\ 1$
    $B\ 1\ 0\ 0$
    $C\ 1\ 0\ 0$

$\text{Num of edges ____,  sum of degree sequence ____ and every vertex has a degree __ for}$
$\text{n-regular graph that has n verticies}$
    
    Given a r-regular graph G with n verticies, then the following is true:
    
    Every vertex has a degree of r, r, r (n times)
    Sum of degree sequence G = r * n
    num of edges = G = r * n / 2

    
$\text{What is a isomorphic graph and what must it be to be isomorphic?}$

    An isomorphic graph is a graph that is bijective. In other words it is a
    graph that you can split into two in such a way that each element in each
    set can map to one another

$\text{Two graphs with different degree sequences can or can not be isomrphic?}$
$\text{explain why}$
    
    They cannot be. Since we cannot create a INVERTIBLE FUNCTION this means
    there is not a bijection , and by definition a isomorphic function requires
    an invertible function
    $f:G_1\rightarrow G_2$
    


$\text{Two graphs with the same degree sequence are or aren't isomorphic? explain}$
    No, they aren't neccecarily isomorphic, an example is:
        
        O                               O 
        |                               |
    O---O---O---O---O           O---O---O---O---O
        |                               | 
        O                               O
        4,2,2,1,1,1,1                   4,2,2,1,1,1,
        
        Yet they are not isomorphic
        
        
$\text{The number of edges in an undirected graph is equal to half the sum of all the}$
$\text{elements }(m_{ij}) \text{of its corresponding adjacency matrix, why?}$
  
  $A\ B\ C$
$A\ 1\ 1\ 1$
$B\ 1\ 0\ 0$
$C\ 1\ 0\ 1$
 
 If we add all these up it equals 6, which divided by 2 is 3 therefore it has 3
 edges. Why does this work? this is because adjacency matrixes double count 
 each pair. If you were to split the matrix from top left to bottom right it would
 always be equal.

$\text{If an adjacency matrix of a digraph has a total sum of 6, how many edges does}$
$\text{it have?}$
    
    6
    And this is by definition of a digraph. Adjacency matrix = edges
    so adjacency list = half edges
