    Determine which of the following walks are trails, paths or circuits
    1. v1 e1 v2 e3 v3 e4 v3 e5 v4
        This is a trail as no edge was repeated, yet vertexes were repeated
        

    2. e1 e3 e5 e5 e6
        This is a walk since it has a repeating edge   
        

    3. v2 v3 v4 v5 v3 v6 v2
      this is a circuit at it ends where it started with no repeated edges

      This is also a circuit

Question 5. In each of the follwing either construct a graph with the specified
properties or say why it is not possible to do so.

    1. A graph with a degree sequence 4, 3, 3, 1.
   
        4 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11 which is odd which cannot be constructed since by
        definition a graph must have an even degree sequence.

Question 6. In a group of 25 people, is it possible to each shake hands with
exactly 3 other people? Explain your answer?

    We can represent this question with a graph, with each person being a vertex,
    and a handshake being represented by an edge.

    One rule about graphs is that you must have an even number of edges to make
    a valid graph. We can calculate the amount of edges by getting the number
    of vertexes, and the degrees per edge and multiplying them together

    25 (vertexes) * 3 (degrees per edge) = 75

    75 is not even so it is impossible for a group of 25 people to shake hands with exactly
    3 other people

    A hamiltonian circuit is a circuit in which you must visit every vertex

Question 9. Suppose that 7 sites are connected in a network. The number of
other sites to which each site has a direct connection is given by the
following sequence

    $1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7$

    1. Describe how a communications network such as this may be modeled by a
       graph saying what the vertices and edges represent and what it means
       when two vertices are adjacent
       
         We can construct a graph that looks like this with the number of
         vertices being the number of sites, and the number of edges being the
         number of connections between two sites. These connections can be one
         way
                        
       
       
       
    2. Say how many vertices it has
    
            It has 7 vertiices, one for each site

        
        
    3. Find how many connections there are between pairs of sites, given a
       brief explanation of your method

        The sum of the degree is twice the number of edges

$ No\ of\ edges= \frac{7 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11$


    4. Say why it is impossible to construct a simple graph with this degree
       sequence
    
       There are 7 vertices or sites but one of them has 7 incident edges. As
       there are only 6 other vertices to connect to, one at least must be a
       parallel edge or a loop.    
    
    
    
    6. Say why it is impossible to construct a network with 9 sites, in which
       each site has a direct connection to exactly 5 of the other sites

        graphs have the property of only being constructable if you have an
        even sum of degrees. This sum of degrees can be calculated by gathering
        the degree of each vertex. We can do this in this situation as follows:
        
        Each 1 site has 5 connections. We have 9 sites, thus we have in total
        we have 9 * 5 = 45 connections. Graphs can only be constructed with an
        even number of connections.

        Every new connecticon must by definition of what an edge is, increase
        the total sum of edges by 2, since 45 is not a multiple of 2 it is
        impossible to construct a network with 9 sites in which each site has a
        direct connection to exactly 5 other sites
    

Question 10.
    1. What is meant by a complete graph?
   
        A complete graph is a graph in which every verticies is linked together
        with an edge
   
   
   
    2. What is the degree of each vertex of the complege graph $K_8$? Calculate
       the number ofe edges in $K_8$Draw $K_8$
  
        The degree of each vertex is n - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
        
        Number of edges = 8(8 - 1) / 2
                        = 8(7) / 2
                        = 56 / 2
                        = 28

    3. What is the degree of each vertex of the complete graph $K_n$? How many
       edges will it have?

        The degree of each vertex is n - 1
        
        num of edges: $\frac{2*(2-1)}{2}$


Question 11. Construct 3 non isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 5 edges.
Give one property for each graph that neither of the other has, which makes it
non-isomorphic

Both graphs have the same degree sequence, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, as they can't be
isomorphic if they have different degree sequences.
To solve this problem we must find a bijection f: V(G1) -> V(G2) so that for
any $v,w\in V(G_1)$, the number of edges connecting v to w is the same as the
number of edges connecting f(v) to f(w). We can claerly see that such a
function exists and it is defined as follows:

$v\in V(G - 1)|\ v1\ |\ v2\ |\ v3\ |\ v4\ |\ v5\ |$
$f(v)\in V(G_2)|\ w2\ |\ w3\ |\ w1\ |\ w5\ |\ w4\ |$

Question 14.
    1. A simple connected graph has 7 vertices, all having the same degree d. Give
    the possible values of d and for each value of d give the number of edges
    of the graph.
    
        d = 6, 4, 2, 0 for d = 6 the num of edges = (7 * 6)/2 = 21
        for d = 4 the num of edges is (7 * 4)/2 = 14
        for d = 2 the num of edges is (7 * 2)/2 = 7
        for d = 0 the num of edges is (7 * 0)/2 = 0
    
    2. Another simple connected graph has 8 vertices, all of the same degree
       sequence d. Draw this graph when d = 4 and give the other possible
       values of d.
        
        
        The other values of d are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Question 18. Find which of the following graphs are bipartite, redraw the
bipartite graphs so that their bipartite nature is evident.

1______2          __2__               2             1_____6        1__2______3
|      |         /     \             / \           /       \       |  |\
|      |        1       3           1   3         5         2      |  | \
|      |         \     /               /           \       /       |  |  \
4______3          5___4               4   6         4_____3        6__5___4
                                       \ /     



a, c, and d are bipartite

b). Suppose the graph were bipartite with disjoint vertex sets V1, and V2,
where no vertices within either V1 or V2 are connected by edges. Then v1 would
be in one of the sets, say V1 , and so v2 and v5 would be in V2 (because each
is connected by an edge to v1). Furthermore, v3 and v4 would be in V1, (because
v3 is connected by an edge to v2 and v4 is connected by an edge to v5 ). But v3
is connected by an edge to v4, and so both cannot be in the same set, V1. This
contradiction shows that the supposition is false, and so the graph is not
bipartite. Another way to look at it is that the graph (b) has a cycle of an
odd length, hence, it can’t be a bipartite graph. (e) Suppose the graph were
bipartite with disjoint vertex sets V1 and V2, where no vertices within either
V1 or V2 are connected by edges. Then the vertex v1 would be in one of the
sets, say V1, and so v2 and v6 would be in V2 (because each is connected by an
edge to v1). Furthermore, v3, v4, and v5 would be in V1, (because all are
connected by edges to v2).But v4 is connected by an edge to v5 , and so both
cannot be in V1. This contradiction shows that the supposition is false, and so
the graph is not bipartite. Another way to look at it is that the graph (e) has
a cycle of an odd length, hence, it can’t be a bipartite graph.
