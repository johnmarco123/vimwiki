There are two basic algorithms for finding minimum-cost spanning trees, and
both are greedy algorithms. 
    * Kruskal's algorithm
        1. Start with the cheapest edges in the spanning tree
        2. repeatedly add the next CHEAPEST EDGE that does not form a cycle
    
    * Prim's algorithm
        1. START WITH ANY ONE NODE, in the spanning tree
        2. Repeatedly add the cheapest edge, and the node it leads to,
           for which the node is not already in the minimum spanning tree 
           (AKA, the graph should have no cycles)
