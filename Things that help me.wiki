= THINGS THAT WORK =
* Enquire farther with your inner parent, if the inner child doesn't say a big
  sentence that doesn't neccacarily mean he doesn't want to talk


== THINGS TO TRY ==
* Acknowledge your inner child that he did a good job when things are going
  well

* And also acknowledge your inner child when things don't go as well and
  support him.

* Record each week how often i can give myself a pat on the back for things i
  did well

* List my maladaptive (dysfunctional) behaviours. What do i do to take care of
  me that doesn't take care of me, its like a coping mechanism
