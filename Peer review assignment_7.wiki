$\text{Find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2,310.}$

    We can reformat this question to how many integers are in the range (0,
    2310) exclusive
    
    Thus our answer is the following set of numbers: {1, 2, 3, ..., 2319} Since
    we know that the numbers go from 1 to 2319 we can know with certainty that
    there are 2319 integers, as we do not count 0.
        
    Therefore, our answer is 2319.
    
$\text{Find the number of positive integers not exceeding 2,310 that are either the}$
$\text{square or the cube of an integer}$

    Let A be the set of all positive integers not exceeding 23,10}
    We already found this before above:
    A = {1, 2, 3, ..., 2319}

    Let A1 be the set of all the positive integers, perfect square and not
    exceeding 2,310
    
    To find this we must find the biggest perfect square that does not exceed
    2,310.
    
    50 * 50 = 2500                    (which is too big so we will go lower.
    49 * 49 = 2500 - 50 - 49 = 2401   (still too big)
    48 * 48 = 2401 - 49 - 48 = 2304   (biggest number under our constraints)
    
    Thus, the largest perfect square is 2,304 (48 * 48)
    
    Therefore, the set of perfect squares that does not exceed 2,310 is the
    following:
    
    $\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2,\ ...\ , 48^2\}$
    
    The same process can be used to find the cubes that dont exceed 2,310
    however, since cubes are much harder to mentally calculate, we will use
    another method.
    We will find the cube root of 2309, and then floor our result
    $3\sqrt{2309} = ~13.22$
    $\text{And the floor of 13.22 is 13}$
    Thus our set is:
    $\{1^3, 2^3, 3^3,\ ...\ ,13^3\}$
   
    Since the number of perfect squares goes from 1 - 48 and the set of
    cubes goes from 1 - 13, the set of positive integers not exceeding 2,310 
    that are either a perfect square or a cube must be from 1 - 13.
    
    Therefore, there are 13 positive integers for the given contraints.
    

%%======================================================
====== CORRECT ANSWER: ======
%%======================================================
There aer 2310 integers not exceeding 2,310, thus,
|A| = 2310 (the cardinality of set A is 2310);
$Since\ 48^2 = 2304\ and 49^2 = 2401,\ there\ are\ 48\ perfect\ squares\ not$
$exceeding 2,310: \{1^3, 2^3, 3^3,\ ...\ 48^2\}$

$|A_1| = 48$

$Since\ 13^3 = 2,197, 14^3 = 2,744\ there\ are\ 13\ perfect\ cubes\ not$
$exceeding 2,310: \{1^3, 2^3, 3^3,\ ...\ ,13^3\}$


$|A_2| = 13$

$\text{A number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube when its the 6th power}$
$\text{of an integer. Since }3^6 = 729\ and\ 4^6 = 4096\ there\ are\ 3\ such\ numbers\ not$
$exceeding\ 2,310: \{1^6, 2^6, 3^6\}$

$|A_1\cap A_2| = 3$

$\text{Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion (subtraction rule)}$
$|A_1\cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2| = 48 + 13 - 3 = 58$
$\text{Thus, there are 58 positive integers not exceeding 2,310 that are a perfect}$
$\text{square or a perfect cube.}$
