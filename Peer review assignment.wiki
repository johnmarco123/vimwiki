Let a be a set with $A = \{n: n\epsilon  \mathbb{Z}^+\ and\ n < 16\}$
and p, q and r be three propositions concerning an integer n in A. 
p means 'n is an odd number'
q means 'n is a prime number'
r means 'n is less then 8'

question a.) find the truth set of the following logical expression:
    $p \land q;\ p \oplus q;\ p \rightarrow q;\ and\ r \rightarrow q$
        
    $p:\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\}$
    $q:\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\}$
    $r:\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$

    $p\land q = \{3, 5, 7, 11, 13\}$ 
    $p \oplus q = \{1, 2, 9, 15\}$
    $p\rightarrow q = \{2,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\}$
    $r \rightarrow q = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\}$


question b.) Express each of the four following compound propositions using p,
q, r, and appropiate logical symbols:

    - 'n is neither odd nor is a prime number' 
    $\lnot p \land \lnot q$
   $\lnot(p \lor q)$ <- suggested answer, basically make sure you simplify

    - 'if n is odd and n less than 8 then n is a prime number' 
    $(p \land r) \rightarrow q$

    - 'n is a prime number only if n is odd' 
    $q \rightarrow p$

    - 'n is a prime number if n is odd' 
    $p \rightarrow q$

question c.) Write in words the contrapositive of the statement given
symbolicaly by 'q -> p'
    $if\ not \ p, \ then \ not \ q$

question 2.) let p and q be two propositions. Using the laws of propositional
logic seen in this topic, show that $(p \rightarrow q) \land p\ =\ p \land q$

$(p \rightarrow q) \land p$
$(\lnot p \lor q) \land p$ <- implication law
$p \land (\lnot p \lor q)$ <- associative law
$(p \land \lnot p) \lor (p \land q)$ <- distributive law
$F \lor (p \land q)$ <- negation law
$p \land q$ <- associative law
