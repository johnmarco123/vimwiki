Subject: Requesting to transfer to Michigan State University

Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing this letter to request to transfer to your school. Currently, I
have been studying veterinary medicine for two semesters now at Ross University
Of Veterinary Medicine. My home is located in ontario canada and i've found
studying so far away from my home very difficult emotionally. Upon viewing
several schools close to my home I found Michigan State University. It was by
far the the most 

appealing choice to me because of their innovations in the field of veterinary
medicine. I was very impressed upon viewing the gene therapy research for
retinitis pigmentosa and it really left the impression on me that MSU is a
committed to the wellbeing of animals and humans.

Another reason why i thought that MSU would be an excellent school to pursue my
veterinary education is because of the way they conduct their exams. I like the
structure of having a few big and important tests more beneficial to me then to 
have weekly block exams.

In conclusion, I hope you can consider my application and give me the opportunity
to study at MSU.

Sincerely,
Geshini Perera
