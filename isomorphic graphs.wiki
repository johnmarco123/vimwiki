Definition of isomorphism
    Two graphs G1 and G2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection (invertible
    function):
        
        f: G1 -> G2 
    
    That preserves adjacency and non adjacency if uv is in E(G1) then f(u)f(v)
    is in E(G2)
    
    
    An example of isomorphic graphs:
    
    
      O-------O             O-------O
     /        |              \      |
    /         |               \_____|___O
   O          |                _____|__/
    \         |               /     |
     \        |              /      |
      O-------O             O-------O
      
    Two graphs with different degree sequences cannot be isomorphic
    for example:
   
    O---O                O--O
    |   |                |\/|
    |   |                |/\|
    O---O                O--O
    
    2, 2, 2, 2          3, 3, 3, 3
      
      
    These cannot be isomorphic
    
    
    Two graphs can have the same degree sequences, but not be isomorphic
    for example:
   
       O                     O 
       |                     |
    O--O--O--O--O      O--O--O--O--O
       |                     | 
       O                     O 
       
    4,2,2,1,1,1,1       4,2,2,1,1,1,1
    
    Same degree, but they are not isomorphic!
