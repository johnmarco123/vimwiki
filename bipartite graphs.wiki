Bipartite graphs
    A graph G(V, E) is called a bi-partite graph:
        If the set of vertices V can be partitioned in two no-empty disjoint
        sets V1 and V2 in such a way that each edge e in G has one endpoint in
        V1 and another endpoint in V2
        
        
        V1 = {A, B, C, D}
        V2 = {X, Y, Z}
        No odd length cycles!
        If we add an edge between Y and X, this would be an odd lenge cycle and
        it would no longer be a Bipartite graph

Matching:
    A matching is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges, none of which are
    loops; that is, no two edges hsare a common endpoint.
    
    A vertex is matched (or saturated) if it is an endpoint of one of the
    edges in the matching. Otherwise the vertex is unmatched.

LORD JESUS THIS SHIT IS CONFUSING
