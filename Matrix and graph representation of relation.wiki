= Union of two relations =
    (Union or joint) is a set of all elements that are in either relation
    
= Intersection of two relations =
    (Intersection) is a set of all elements that are in both relations

= Definition of reflexivity =
    A relation R in a set S is said to be reflexive if and only if
    $x\ R\ x, \forall x\in S$
    $(x, x)\in R, \forall x\in S$

    Example:
        * Let R be a relation of elements in Z:
            * $R = \{(a, b)\in Z^2|a\leq b\}$
            * for all x elements of Z, we have $x\leq x, $ hence x R x
            * This imlies that R is reflexive
    
= Definition of symmetry =
    A relation R on a set S is said to be symmetric if and only if
    $\forall a, b\in S,\ if\ a\ R\ b\ then\ b\ R\ a$
    * Example:
    * Let R be a relation of elements in Z:
        * $R = \{(a, b)\in Z^2|a\ mod\ 2 =  b\ mod\ 2\}$
        * Proof: let $let\ a,\ b\in Z\ with\ a\ R\ b:$
            * $a\ mod\ 2 = b\ mod\ 2$
            * $\text{b mod 2 = a mod 2}$
            * $b\ R\ a$
            * R is symmetric
    
    * Example digraph of a symmetric relation
    * Let S = {1, 2, 3, 4} and R be a relation of elements in S
      R = $\{(a, b)\in S^2|a\ mod\ 2 = b\ mod\ 2\}$

= Definition of antisymmetry =
    A relation R on a set S is said to be antisymmetric if and only if
    $\forall a, b\in S,\ if\ a\ R\ b\ and\ b\ R\ a\ then\ a = b$
    * Example:
        * Let R be a relation of elements in Z:
            * $R = \{(a, b)\in Z^2|a\leq b\}$
            * Proof: let $let\ a,\ b\in Z\ with\ a\ R\ b\ and\ b\ R\ a:$
                * $a\leq b\ and\ b\leq a$
                * $a = b$
                * R is antisymmetric
    

    * Example digraph of an antisymmetric relation
        * Let S = {1, 2, 3, 4} and R be a relation of elements in S
            * $R = \{(a, b)\in S^2|a\ divides\ b\}$

= Definition of transitivity =
    A relation R on a set S is said to be transitive if and only if
    $\forall a, b, c\in S,\ if\ a\ R\ b\ and\ b\ R\ c\ then\ a\ R\ c$
    * Example:
        * Let R be a relation of elements in Z:
            * $R = \{(a, b)\in Z^2|a\leq b\}$
            * Proof: let $let\ a,\ b,\ c\in Z\ with\ a\ R\ b\ and\ b\ R\ c:$
                * $a\leq b\ and\ b\leq c$
                * $a\leq c$
                * $a\ R\ c$
                * R is transitive


= Definition of equivelance relation =
    Let R be a relation on a set S. R is said to be an equivelance relation if
    and only if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive
    
    
    
= Definition of a partial order = 
    Let R be a relation on a set S. R is said to be a partial order if
    and only if R is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive
    
    An example of a partial order is the relation of elements in Z:
    $R = \{(a, b)\in Z^2|a\leq b\}$
    It can easily be proved that R is:
        Reflexive as $a\leq a\forall a\in Z$
        Transitive as $a\leq b\ and\ b\leq c\implies a\leq c\ \forall a, b, c\in Z$
        Antisymmetric as $a\leq b\ and\ b\leq a\implies a = b\ \forall a, b\in Z$
        
= Definition of a total order =
    Let R be a relation on a set S. R is said to be a total order if
    and only if R is a partial order and for all a, b in S, either a R b OR b R a
    
    An example of a total order is the relation of elements in Z:
    $R = \{(a, b)\in Z^2|a\leq b\}$
    It can easily be proved that R is:
        Reflexive as $a\leq a\forall a\in Z$
        Transitive as $a\leq b\ and\ b\leq c\implies a\leq c\ \forall a, b, c\in Z$
        Antisymmetric as $a\leq b\ and\ b\leq a\implies a = b\ \forall a, b\in Z$
        Total as $a\leq b\ or\ b\leq a\ \forall a, b\in Z$
