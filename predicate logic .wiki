Can't be described with predicate logic: 

    Below is not a proposition since x is not defined
    $x^2 = 4$

    * It's not a proposition, as its truth value is a function depending on x

    * This can't be expressed with propositional logic but predicate logic
      will enable us to formalise it.

== Universal quantifier ==
    <span style="color:#b16286;">Definition:</span>
        * The universal quantification of a predicate P(x) is the proposition:
            * "P(x) is true for all values of x in the universe of discourse"
            * We use the notation:
             $\forall x\ P(x)$
             which is read "for all x"
        
        If the universe of discourse is finite, say $\{n_1, n_2,...,n_k\},$
        then the universal quantifier is simply the conjunction of the
        propositions over all the elements:
        $\forall x\ P(x) \leftrightarrow P(n_1) \land P(n_2) \land...\land P(n_k)$



    Every CS student must take a discrete mathematics course.
    $\forall x\ Q(x) \rightarrow P(x)$

    Everybody must take a discrete mathematics course or be a CS student
    
    $\forall x\ Q(x) \lor P(x)$
    
    Everybody must take a discrete mathematics course and be a CS student
    
    $\forall x\ Q(x) \land P(x)$
    
== Existential quantifier ==
    <span style="color:#b16286;">Definition:</span>
        * The existential quantification of a predicate P(x) is the
          proposition:
            * "There exists a value x in the universe of discourse such that
              P(x) is true" 
        * We use the notation:
         $\exists x\ P(x)$
         which is read "there exists x".
        
        If the universe of discourse is finite, say $\{n_1, n_2,...,n_k\},$
        then the existential quantifier is simply the disjunction of the
        propositions over all the elements:
        $\exists x\ P(x) \leftrightarrow P(n_1) \lor P(n_2) \lor...\lor P(n_k)$
        
        Examples:
        
        Let P(x,y) denote the statement "x + y = 5". The expression:
        $E: \exists x \exists y\ P(x, y)$
        means:
         
        * "there exists a value x and a value y in the universe of discourse
          such that x +  y = 5 is true."

== Uniqueness quantifier ==
    <span style="color:#b16286;">Definition:</span>
        * The uniqueness quantification of a predicate P(x) is the
          proposition:
            * "There exists a unique value x in the universe of discourse such that
              P(x) is true" 
        * We use the notation:
         $\exists! x\ P(x)$
         which is read "there exists a unique x".

        Examples:
        
        Let P(x) denote the statement $x^2 = 4$
        * The expression $E: \exists!x\ P(x)$ means:
            * "There exists a unique value x in the universe of discourse such
              that $x^2 = 4$ is true."
        
        For instance
        * If the universe of discourse is positive integers, E is True ( as x =
          2 is the unique solution)
        
== Nested quantifiers ==
$\forall x\forall y\ P(x, y) = P(x, y)\ is\ true\ for\ every\ pair\ x,\ y.$
$\exists x \exists y\ P(x, y) = There\ is\ a\ pair\ x,\ y\ for\ which\ P(x, y)\ is\ true$
$\forall x \exists y\ P(x, y) = For\ every\ x\ there\ is\ a\ y\ for\ which\ P(x,\ y)\ is\ true.$
$\exists x \forall y\ P(x,y) = There\ is\ an\ x\ for\ which\ P(x, y)\ is\ true$

== Binding variables ==
    * A variable is said to be bound if it is within the scope of a quantifier
    * A variable is free if it is not bound by a quantifier or particular values.

Example:
    * Let P be a propositiona; function
    * And S the statement: $\exists x\ P(x, y)$
    * We can say that:
        * x is bound
        * y is free

== Logical operations == 
Examples:
    * If P(x) denotes "x > 3" and Q(x) denotes "x squared is even" then:
        * $\exists x\ (P(x)\land Q(x))\equiv T\ (ex.\ x\ =\ 4)$
        * $\forall x\ (P(x)\rightarrow Q(x))\equiv F\ (ex.\ x\ =\ 5)$

== Order of operations == 
    * $\forall x\forall y\ P(x, y)\equiv\forall y\forall x\ P(x, y)$
    * $\exists x\exists y\ P(x, y)\equiv\exists y\exists x\ P(x, y)$
    * $\forall x\exists y\ P(x, y)\ is\ different\ from\exists y\forall x\ P(x, y)$

The quantiefiers
$\forall and \exists$
have a higher presedence priority than all logical operators.
