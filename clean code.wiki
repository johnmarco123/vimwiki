    * code that works is 50% the other 50 is cleaning the code after! 
 <span style="color:#98971a;">      
    * functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long
    * first rule of functions - they should be small
    * smallness also implies:
    * functions should not be large enough to hold nested structures.
    * therefore the indent level of a function should not be greater than
    one or two
    * small variable scope -> small name
    * big variable scope -> BIG name
    * big function scope -> small name
    * small function scope -> BIG name

    test driven code:
    * test first till it passes (do least amount possible)
    * then code till test passes (least amount possible)
    * repeat
    * production code more general test code more specific
    * avoid central behaviour as much as possible

    * comments -> let your code explain you not your comments unless you 
      absolutely can't
