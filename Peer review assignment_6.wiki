Let R be a relation on Z given by xRy if and only if 
$x^2 - y^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3$
Show that this relation is an equivalence relation and find its
corresponding equivalence classes.

To show it is a equivalence relation we must prove that it is 
reflexive, symmetric and transitive

* The equation is symmetric since you can switch x and y and the statement
  still holds.
    * To be symmetric, if this 
    * $x^2 - y^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3$
    * $y^2 - x^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3$
    * An example of this would be the following:
    * $3^2 - 6^2 = 9 - 36 = -27$ 
    * $6^2 - 3^2  = 36 - 9 = 27$ 
    * Which is divisible by 3
    * Hence it is symmetric
 
* The equation is reflexive:
    * $x^2 - y^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3$
    * $x^2 - x^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3$
    * $x^2 - x^2 \text{ will always result in 0, as any number divided by itelf is zero}$
    $\text{ and zero is divisible by 3, so therefore the statement is also reflexive}$
    * Hence it is reflexive


* The equation is transitive:
    * $x^2 - y^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3$
    * $y^2 - z^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3$
    * $Therefore\ x^2 - z^2\ is\ disibile\ by\ 3$
    * $\text{This is because the only way to get a number divisible by three}$
    * $\text{In this equation, is by having both numbers already be divisible by 3}$
    * Hence, it is transitive

* The equivalence classes are as follows:
    * $[0] = \{y \in Z |x^2 - y^2\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3\}$
    * $[1] = \{y \in Z |x^2 - 1\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3\}$
    * $[2] = \{y \in Z |x^2 - 4\ is\ divisible\ by\ 3\}$

    These are the equivelant classes, however 1, and 2 are the same class so 
    we have 2 classes, [0] and [1]
