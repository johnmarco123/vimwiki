    Properties of simple graphs:
        Given a simple graph G with n vertices, then the degree
        of each vertex G is at most equal to n - 1.
        where n is the amount of nodes
        
= r regular graph =
    A graph is said to be regular of degree if all local degrees are the
    same
    
    number A graph G where all the verticies the same degree, r, is 
    called an r- regular graph

   Given a r-regular G with n verticies, then the following is true:
   Degree sequence of G=r,r,...,r,r(n times)
   sum of degree sequence of G = r * n
   num of edges in G = r * n / 2
   
= complete graph =
    A complete graph is a simple graph where every pair of verticies are
    adjacent (linked with an edge) We represent a complete graph with n
    verticies using the symbol $K_n$
    
    Basically any two verticies have a direct link (or an edge)
    between them
    
    Every vertex has a degree = (n - 1) 
    Sum of degree sequence = n(n - 1) 
    Number of edges = n(n - 1) / 2
