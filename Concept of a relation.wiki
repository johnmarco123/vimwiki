= Cartesian product =
    Let A and B be two sets
    The Cartesian product A x B is defined by a set of pairs (x, y) such that
    $x\in A\ and\ y\in B$
        $A\ x\ B = \{(x, y):x\in A\ and\ y\in B\}$
        

= Definition of a relation =
    Let A and B be two sets.
    A binary relation from A to B is a subset of a Cartesian product A x B
        * $R\subseteq A\ x\ B$ means R is a set of ordered pairs of the form
          (x, y) where $x\in A\ and y\in B$
        * $(x, y)\in R$means x R y (x is related to y)
        * For example:
            * $A = \{a, b, c\}\ and\ B=\{1, 2, 3\}$
            * The following is a relation defined from A to B:
                * $\{(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)\}$
                * This means that: A R 1, b R 2 and c R 3
            
Example:
    * A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    * Let R be a relation on the set A:
        * $x, y\in A, x\R Y\ if\ and\ only\ if\ x < y$
        * We have: 1 R 2, 1 R 3, 1 R 4, 2 R 3, 2 R 4, 3 R 4
        * R = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)}
