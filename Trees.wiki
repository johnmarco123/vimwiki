= spanning trees: =
   To get a spanning tree of a graph G:
   1. Keep all the vertices of G
   2. Break all the cycles but keep the tree connected

    Here are some examples of spanning trees of a graph:
    
      G1       Spanning trees
    o______o    o______o   o______o  o      o  o______o
    | .... |      .... |   | ....    | .... |  | .... |
    |      | =>        |   |         |      |  |      |
    |      |           |   |         |      |  |      |
    o______o    o______o   o______o  o______o  o      o
    
= non isomorphic spanning trees =
    Two spanning trees are isomorphic if there is a bijection between
    preserving adjacency between the two trees
    
    Here are two isomorphic spanning trees of a graph:
     
        G1         T1         T2        T3        T4
     o______o    o______o   o      o  o      o  o______o
     |\     |           |   |\     |  |     /   | .... |
     | \    |           |   | \    |  |    /    | .... |
     |  \   | =>        |   |  \   |  |   /     |      |
     |   \  |           |   |   \  |  |  /      |      |
     |    \ |           |   |    \ |  | /       |      |
     |     \|           |   |     \|  |/        |      |
     o______o    o______o   o      o  o______o  o      o
    
    
    
    T1, T2, T4 are isomorphic to each other
    T1, T2, T4 are not isomorphic to T3
