Consider the following graph. Use Dijkstra's algorithm and operate the
iterations to fill in the following table with the shortest path from vertex A
to all other verticies and find the shortest distance from A to E.

First we initialize our table:
Unvisited List {A, B, C, D, E}
 ____________________________________________________________
| Vertex   | Shortest distance from a   | Previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | inf                        | undefined          |
| C        | inf                        | undefined          |
| D        | inf                        | undefined          |
| E        | inf                        | undefined          |
|__________|____________________________|____________________|

Then we will start by filling in A
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 4                          | A                  |
| C        | 3                          | A                  |
| D        | inf                        | undefined          |
| E        | inf                        | undefined          |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
then we pick the vertex with the smallest known distance from start
vertex A which is vertex C Unvisited List {B, C, D, E}  
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 4                          | A                  |
| C        | 3                          | A                  |
| D        | 5                          | C                  |
| E        | 9                          | C                  |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
then we pick the next vertex with the smallest known distance from start
vertex A, which is vertex B Unvisited List {B, D, E}  
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 4                          | A                  |
| C        | 3                          | A                  |
| D        | 5                          | C                  |
| E        | 9                          | C                  |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
then we pick the vertex with the smallest known distance from start
vertex A which is D Unvisited List {D, E}  
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 4                          | A                  |
| C        | 3                          | A                  |
| D        | 5                          | C                  |
| E        | 8                          | D                  |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |
Now all we have is E, and E already has been attended from all 
the other calculations So this is our final table
____________________________________________________________
| vertex   | shortest distance from a   | previous vertex    |
| A        | 0                          |                    |
| B        | 4                          | A                  |
| C        | 3                          | A                  |
| D        | 5                          | C                  |
| E        | 8                          | D                  |
| ________ | __________________________ | __________________ |

Therefore, we can see that the shortest path to E from A is
A -> C -> D -> E
