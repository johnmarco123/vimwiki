Question 1. 
Consider the following graph G, with the following vertices: w, x, y and z.


              x                                              
             / \                                             
            /   \                                           
           /     \                                          
          /       \                                         
         /         \                                        
        w-----------y                                       
       / \         /                                        
       \  \       /                                          
        \  \     /                                           
         \  \   /                                            
          \  \ /                                            
           \__z                                             
           
    1. Find the degree sequence of the graph G
    
    {4, 3, 3, 2}


    2. Draw two non-isomorphic spanning trees of G
        
        DONE


    


    3. Let A be the adjacency matrix of G, write down A
        
       | w | x | y | z |
     w | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
     x | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
     y | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
     z | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 |


    4. What information does the sum of elements in A tell you about G?
    The sum of the elements is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12. 
    
    This is twice the number of edges in the graph:
    12 / 2 = 6 edges

Question 2.



    1. Draw a binary search tree to store 14 records

        DONE

    2. Find the maximum number of comparisons needed to find any existing records.

        The worst casetime complexity of searching in a binary search tree is
        O(log n).

        Let n represent the number of records in the tree. The maximum number of
        comparisons needed to find any existing record is log n rounded to the 
        next highest integer.
        
        Therefore the amount of comparisons needed is Log 14 = 3.8 = 4
