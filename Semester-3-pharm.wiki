The dosage of a drug in a cat weighing 10.5 lb is 50 mg/ kg b.i.d for 5d PO.
What is the total number of tablets if the drug is available as 100 mg tablets?
(25 tablets)

10.5 lb = 5.25 kg

We can reframe the question as how many 100 mg tablets do we need for a
cat who needs 50 mg/kg twice a day for five days?

Since the cat ways 5.25 kg 50 mg * 5.25 kg = 262.5mg is needed twice a day
so for one day we need 262.5mg * 2days = 525 mg a day.
for 5 days we would need 525 * 5 = 2625mg total

so we would need 1312 = 14 tablets?
